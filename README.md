## Contributing - individual project
Purpose: learning git common features
- Used SSH to link both local git repo to remote GitHub accoutn
- Create a new repository on github called python-task-tracker

1. Clone the Project ('git clone git@github.com:macdit3/python-task-tracker.git')
2. Open command Line interface (cmd) inside python-task-tracker ('code .') to open the project in VS Code IDE
3. Check status of the current project directory ('git status  ')
4. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'adding new changes to local git'`)
5. Push changes to remote repo (`git push git@github.com:macdit3/python-task-tracker.git`)
